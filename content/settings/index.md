## Tutorial

From here you can access a quick and clear tutorial that will teach you all the secrets behind WETHOD, but remember: **with great power comes great responsibility.**

Clicking on "**let me try**" will pause the tutorial and let you take a look around, to resume the tutorial just click on the bottom right button.

Clicking on "**skip tour**" will close the tutorial.

## Account

Here you set your **name**, **surname** and **password**.

If you have the right permissions, you can:

* Change your invoice details;

* Import existing projects.

## Team

Since you have the right permissions, you can: **invite people**, **assign specific roles** and **allow special permissions**.

To invite a new teammate:

1. Click on the top left "**+ new user**" button;

1. Assign a *user level*, a *role *and the *email address* of the person you want to invite;

1. Click the "**invite**" button. Once done, an email will be sent to the given address.

## Company

Here you can configure your company by setting:

* **User levels**: each one of your collaborators has a level which defines his daily cost to the company and the price you want to sell a day of his work to the clients. This way you can define clusters of employees like intern, junior, senior and so on;

* **Job Order Categories**: each one of your projects must have one, this way you can organize your projects into any category you like according to your business practice. Each category has some useful features:
	* **Chargeable** define whether the projects in this category are chargeable or not;
	* **Everybody can plan** if checked, all the projects in the category can be planned by everyone, regardless the company permissions,
	* **Must be in Program** if checked all, the projects in the category must be added to a [Program](http://support.wethod.com/pipeline/index/#programs) when their probability reaches 90%.

* **Email Bot**: here you can insert the email addresses to which send invoices and orders;

* **Project Won/Lost Bot**: here you can insert the email addresses to which send notifications each time someone of your teammates won or lost a project. A project is considered to be *lost* when its probability is 0 and *won* when its probability is 90;

* **Default Areas**: these will be suggested when you're creating a [new budget]({{< relref "budget/index.md#the-workflow" >}}) or when you're adding a new area to an existing budget;

* **Timesheet**: here you can choose to automate the timesheets creation process. This way, timesheets are automatically created each Friday based on planned hours. *Be careful: shit happens and planning is often not 100% accurate, this is why timesheet exists.*

## Permissions

Here you can set permissions for the various user's role:

* **Budget, Invoices, Orders, Pipeline, Planning, Project Status, Timesheet**: who can do what;

* **Dashboard**: which widgets are available to who;

* **Header**: which section of WETHOD are available;

* **Reports**: which sections of *Reports *are available;

* **Settings**: who can access *Settings*.

*Here the word "other" means "of his/her teammates". For example: in the budget table, "view other" means "view his/her teammates budget".*

*The roles "Account" and "PM" are dynamic: you can assign them only from a project.*

To create a new role:

1. Click on the top left "**+ add role**" button;

1. Assign a name to the newly created role;

1. Click the "**save**" button.
