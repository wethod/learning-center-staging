## Overview

WETHOD follows a weekly cycle: we think that a week is a good trade-off between the need to control the project's progress as much as possible and the need to not burden the control activities.

Every Friday an e-mail will remind:

* Each project manager to compile the Project Status for its projects;

* Each collaborator to compile the Timesheet for the projects he worked on.

## Timesheet

At the end of each week, type in here the actual hours you've spent working on the projects you are involved in. It's all really easy, fast and simple.

Each project can be pinned to find it faster later.

The data inserted here will be used to determine the actual [budget consumption]({{< relref "reports/index.md#budget-consumption" >}}) in terms of work hours for each project.

**Remember to insert only the real worked hours, cheating isn't useful to anybody.**

## Project Status

At the end of each week, the project manager estimates the days left to finish the project and inserts this number here.

For each project the last project status is shown too, this way you can quickly compare the project's progress.

**Project Status must not be compiled looking at Timesheet, but thinking seriously about how much work still to be done.**
