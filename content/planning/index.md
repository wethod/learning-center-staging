## Overview

The planning is useful to look at teammates availability, allocate them for projects and check that you respect the budget quota.

You can plan a person by half-days: we think it's not worth planning by more fine-grained amounts of time. If your tasks require less time, just group them!

**You cannot plan people for the current day: if you don't know what you have to do when you arrive at the office, how can you be productive?**

## The Structure

The main part of this section is a kind of calendar: on the top you have the days and on the left all your teammates are listed, to allocate a person you just need to click on the intersection between the day and the person name.

On the top you have three buttons, from the left:

* The **select project button** let you select the project for which you want to allocate people. Once the project is selected only the half-days allocated for that project will be highlighted, this allow you to still have a general view on the teammates which are already allocated. Â When selecting a project, a container will be shown: inside it you can see all the budget days left (by user level), these are the days that can be used to allocate people;

* The **filter people button** let you filter the teammates you want to see in the planning;

* The **switch weeks button** let you travel in time, you can see future and past weeks.
