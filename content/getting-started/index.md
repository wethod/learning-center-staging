## Setup Your Company

By clicking on your initials (in the top right corner), the **Settings** menu will be shown and you can select the [Company]({{< relref "settings/index.md#company" >}}) section to configure your team.

Now you can invite your team members by visiting the **Team** section.

Here we are, you are ready to start!

## The Workflow

1. Add a project to your [Pipeline]({{< relref "pipeline/index.md" >}});

2. Provide a [budget]({{< relref "budget/index.md" >}}) for the project;

3. Assign people to the project by using the [Planning]({{< relref "planning/index.md" >}});

4. Every Friday an e-mail will remind:
	- Each project manager to compile the [Project Status]({{< relref "friday/index.md#project-status" >}}) for its projects;
  	- Each collaborator to compile the [Timesheet]({{< relref "friday/index.md#timesheet" >}}) for the projects he worked on.

When you want to check the status of your projects, just visit the [Reports]({{< relref "reports/index.md" >}}) section: we take care of aggregate the data for you, just sit down and get ready to feel the power of knowledge.

The beating heart of WETHOD is the [Dashboard]({{< relref "dashboard/index.md" >}}): a customizable set of widgets that you can use to be constantly updated on the relevant information about the projects you care about the most.
